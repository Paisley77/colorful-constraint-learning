# The Color of Constraints: A Geo-Semantic HSV Interface for Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning 

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Official implementation of **"The Color of Constraints"** — a novel neurosymbolic framework for Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) that learns interpretable spatio-temporal constraints by projecting high-dimensional states into a structured HSV color manifold.

## Overview

A fundamental limitation in current neurosymbolic AI is the *broken interface* between neural perception and symbolic reasoning. Existing ICRL methods use flat predicate vectors that:
- **Entangle semantic concepts** without clear separation
- **Lack temporal coherence** and robustness to noise
- **Rely on rigid logical formalisms** with limited expressivity

This project introduces a **geometric-semantic interface** that transforms raw state trajectories into a structured HSV color space where constraint manifolds become visually apparent and temporally rich patterns can be learned efficiently.

## Methodology

### Core Innovation: The HSV Semantic Interface

We bridge the neurosymbolic gap through a principled geometric approach:

#### 1. **Symbolic Concept Projection**
A parameterized neural network `g_θ` maps raw states to concept activation vectors:
```math
𝐚_t = g_θ(s_t) = MLP_θ(CNN(s_t))
```

#### 2. **Structured Color Embedding**
We project concept vectors into an HSV-inspired latent space using PCA-based transformations:

- **Hue**: Primary semantic category (circular, continuous)
- **Saturation**: Confidence of semantic assignment  
- **Value**: Semantic prominence or significance

The complete mapping `φ: ℝ^k → ℍ ⊂ ℝ³`:
```math
φ(𝐚_t) = [atan2(p_{t,2}, p_{t,1})/2π mod 1, √(Σ p_{t,i}²/λ_i), tanh(‖𝐚_t‖₂/σ)]
```

#### 3. **Temporal Coherence via Smoothing**
We maintain temporal continuity through recurrent color smoothing:
```math
𝐜_t = α·𝐜_{t-1} + (1-α)·𝐜_t^{target}
```

### Multi-Stage Constraint Learning

#### Stage 1: Foundation Learning
- **Objective**: Learn basic semantic separation
- **Method**: Contrastive loss that clusters expert trajectories while separating violators
- **Result**: Establishes the fundamental semantic coordinate system

#### Stage 2: Weak Temporal Pattern Learning  
- **Objective**: Capture simple temporal constraints
- **Method**: Smooth temporal logic operators applied to the color manifold
- **Result**: Learns robust "always/eventually" style constraints

#### Stage 3: Complex Temporal Pattern Learning
- **Objective**: Capture elaborate, long-horizon patterns
- **Method**: Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) operating on color trajectories
- **Result**: Learns sophisticated multi-scale temporal dependencies
